Asia Tech Stocks: Mixed Sentiment in May 2025

Regional technology stocks in Asia presented a mixed picture in early May 2025. While semiconductor demand remains high, particularly benefiting companies like TSMC, concerns about inflation and rising interest rates are creating a cautious sentiment. Supply chain stability has improved compared to previous years. Key markets like Taiwan and South Korea are seeing sustained investment in tech infrastructure. However, geopolitical factors continue to be an overhang for the broader regional outlook. Companies with strong pricing power and innovative products are expected to navigate the current environment more effectively.
