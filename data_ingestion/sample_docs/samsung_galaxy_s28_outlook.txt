Samsung Electronics Faces Headwinds for Galaxy S28 Launch

Seoul, South Korea – May 10, 2025 – Samsung Electronics is preparing for the launch of its flagship Galaxy S28 smartphone lineup. However, analysts predict a challenging market. While the mobile division saw a slight revenue increase in the last quarter, overall profit margins were squeezed due to rising component costs and intense competition. Samsung's foundry business, however, showed resilience. The company missed earnings estimates by 2% last quarter. Investors are keenly watching for innovations in the S28 to drive sales. Regional sentiment in Asia for consumer electronics is currently cautious due to rising yields on bonds, impacting discretionary spending.
